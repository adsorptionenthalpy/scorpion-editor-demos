# Scorpion Editor

[![Overview Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/7gm3xcmardw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gm3xcmardw)

Note: This is an ongoing work-in-progress version of the Scorpion Editor for Windows and the included Commodore Amiga game samples. It isn't feature complete, is likely to have more than a handful of breaking bugs, and may not work on every Windows configuration - Windows 10 is the recommended OS. Updates will be released on an "early and often" basis.
