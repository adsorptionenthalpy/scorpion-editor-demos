You are entitled to distribute games created with the Scorpion any way you wish (free or commercially), including with the free version of the editor, provided that you have legal rights to use all other IP associated with the game.

---

You are not entitled to use any other splash screen other than the default for the version of the Scorpion Engine you have access to. The exceptions to this is if you are a backer of the PixelGlass Ultimate Level Patreon (in which case any splash screen is allowable), or that you have come to a special arrangement with PixelGlass.

---

If you are entitled to use the Scorpion Engine Ultimate Edition, you do not have to mention the Scorpion Engine on your own custom splash screen, though we would prefer that you did.

The future development of Scorpion Engine relies on voluntary backer support, especially for developing documentation and tutorials, editor support on other platforms, engine support on other consoles and computers, and ongoing creation of new features and performance optimization.

Although this isn't strictly required, ethically:

* All self published games with a small commercial run (say, less than 50 copies) should use the Scorpion Engine Gold Edition or higher.
* All self published games with a larger commercial run (say, 50 copies or more) should use the Scorpion Engine Ultimate Edition.

Publishers should contact the Scorpion Engine developers at admin@pixelglass.org to discuss licensing and custom versions of the engine or splash screen.

You may not use assets from sample games within commercial games, or sell those assets separately, unless you have legal right to do so. Some of the Scorpion Engine games use assets sourced from sites like OpenGameArt - if you're interested in using those assets, please check the original licenses or with the original artists to ensure that commercial use is allowed, or if credit is required.
